# <a href="http://peternatewood.com" target="_blank">Personal Website</a>
My personal website begun on 1 November 2015 during my time at Dev Bootcamp. Visit my site <a href="http://peternatewood.com" target="_blank">here</a>! I keep the site updated with my programming projects, resume, and an irregular blog.

## Design
The site is single-page, by way of AJAX requests, but offers a multi-page version as a backup; in the event that a user has disabled JavaScript, or the client is not compatible with the latest version of jQuery, the website appears to behave as normal.

## Modularity
Desigining a website to provide a pleasant user experience on every device is no small task. My current goal to improve the site, is to do just that. As of this writing, I am working to update the site's styling using plain CSS to alter the page depending on the device being used to view it.
