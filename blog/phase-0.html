          When it was created in San Francisco in 2012, Dev Bootcamp (DBC) featured a course segmented into three phases, numbering one through three. The program was intended for those with some experience in web-related programming languages, but many students began Phase 1 with no prior programming knowledge. For some time, DBC suffered a significant drop-out rate. Phase 0 was introduced to remedy the issue: nine weeks of basic training to prepare for the bootcamp proper.
        </p>
        <p class="debug">
          Phase 0 requires much less time per week than the subsequent Phases: I kept my 40-hour-per-week day job and had no trouble keeping up with the coursework. This part of the program reminded me of my time at college. I only needed to spend a few hours each day learning new skills and completing challenges. Even as I write, DBC is working to improve Phase 0 based on feedback from the students. Future students are likely to have a much different experience from mine, so describing the details of my Phase 0 would be distracting and unhelpful. Instead, I'll focus on the core concepts of this Phase.

          I spent over a month researching Dev Bootcamp before I applied: reading over the official website, comparing with competitors, and talking with an alumnus. I was still apprehensive going into Phase 0; the nine weeks of this Phase were encouraging, but I wouldn't find real peace until I began the on-site course. In the meantime, I learned about Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and several things crucial to modern programming: version control, emotional intelligence, and pair programming.
        <p class="debug">
					I could go on for hundreds of lines about just one of the three programming languages I learned. Instead, I'll summarize each and describe how they work together. Ruby is a language designed to read like English and be easy to learn: this language is used for processing data and dealing with things in the background, a.k.a. the back-end.

          Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) is the language used to organize a web page, 'marking up' the text with tags to define how it looks: we usually add a Cascading StyleSheet (CSS) to make the page look nice and modern.

          JavaScript gives life to the web page: moving, resizing, re-coloring, or otherwise altering the HTML to make the page more interactive. SQL (pronounced like the word 'sequel') is the most boring: we just use this to get information from a database into our Ruby code.
