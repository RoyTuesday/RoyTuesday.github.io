          When it was created in San Francisco in 2012, Dev Bootcamp (DBC) featured a course segmented into three phases, numbering one through three. The program was intended for those with some experience in web-related programming languages, but many students began Phase 1 with no prior programming knowledge. For some time, DBC suffered a significant drop-out rate. Phase 0 was introduced to remedy the issue: nine weeks of basic training to prepare for the bootcamp proper.

          Phase 0 requires much less time per week than the subsequent Phases: I kept my 40-hour-per-week day job and had no trouble keeping up with the coursework. This part of the program reminded me of my time at college. I only needed to spend a few hours each day learning new skills and completing challenges. Even as I write, DBC is working to improve Phase 0 based on feedback from the students. Future students are likely to have a much different experience from mine, so describing the details of my Phase 0 would be distracting and unhelpful. Instead, I'll focus on the core concepts of this Phase.

          I spent over a month researching Dev Bootcamp before I applied: reading over the official website, comparing with competitors, and talking with an alumnus. I was still apprehensive going into Phase 0; the nine weeks of this Phase were encouraging, but I wouldn't find real peace until I began the on-site course. In the meantime, I found that the modern programmer is expected to enact version control,  and engage in pair programming.
