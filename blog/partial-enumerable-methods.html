    Ever wanted to iterate using times?

    Cycle is a very simple method, which works a lot like times. I took the example from the Ruby docs for this method and toyed around with it:
  </p>
  <pre>
a = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
a.cycle( 3 ) { |x| puts x }

#=> a
#=> b
#=> c
  </pre>
  <p>
    That's pretty straightforward, but I wanted to get a little more complicated:
  </p>
  <pre>
a.cycle( 6 ) { |x| puts x + " thing" }

#=> a thing
#=> b thing
#=> c thing
# First cycle

#=> a thing thing
#=> b thing thing
#=> c thing thing
# Second cycle
...
#=> a thing thing thing thing thing thing
#=> b thing thing thing thing thing thing
#=> c thing thing thing thing thing thing
# Sixth cycle
  </pre>
  <p>
    That's way too many "things" for my liking! While 'times' repeats a block of code a certain number of times, cycle iterates through an object, passing the block to each element, then iterating again until it reaches the number passed to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be careful! If you don't pass an argument to cycle, it will go on forever!
  </p>

    Cycle is very basic, like 'times' for enumerables. I imagine that other other methods may be better for specific instances, but cycle may be good to know for those times when you just need to repeat a code block.
