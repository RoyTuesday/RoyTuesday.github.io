    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    I was hesitant to do anything too fancy in the wireframe, since I have little knowledge of formatting in HTML. I was glad to have a partner for this challenge; I had not done the wireframing challenge yet, and Will was a big help to me.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Yes, I was glad to be able to arrange everything visually before moving into the HTML file to try and realize it. Wireframing is exactly the sort of technique that works well for me; once I can see the end product, it's much easier for me to realize it.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    Our wireframe was very simple, because we avoided doing anything that involved formatting or css. I think we agreed that a wireframe should be visually appealing while also basic.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
	We used only basic HTML tags for this challenge. I've spent enough time learning HTML on my own and working on the other challenges from this week that I didn't learn any new elements.
