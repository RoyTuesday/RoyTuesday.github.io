    Based on the game <em>Battle Tanks</em> from <em>Triple Action</em> by Mattel Electronics. A two-player game using the same keyboard; destroy the other player more times to win!<br/><br/>

    <a href="{{ '/projects/tanks-js' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Play it here!</a>

  <p class="article-body">
    Player one uses the arrow keys, and player two uses WASD. Rotate your tank with the left/right arrows, or A and D; move forward with the up arrow or W; and fire a shell with the down arrow or S. One hit will destroy your tank, and shells ricochet off the level boundaries and walls; be mindful of your firing angle, or you'll destroy your own tank!<br/><br/>

    To start, choose how many rounds you want to play: 1 to 15. Choose which colors you want the tanks to be, pick your level, and tap the spacebar to begin playing!<br/><br/>
