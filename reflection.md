#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Between this challenge and the 3.4 dev tools pairing session, I learned how to differentiate padding, borders, and margin. Margin is the outermost reaches of an element, an invisible frame that is best used to visually separate elements. The border is where the visual part of the element begins: background color will fill the element up to the border, for example. The border itself is invisible by default, like a threshold for the element, but it can be set to any width, curved with "border-radius," and colored. Padding separates the content of the element, like text or an image, from the border. The right amount of padding gives content breathing room.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I'm much more confident using the display and position attributes, although I need to research float a little more. I now know how to use the five display properties effectively: relative, absolute, static, fixed and sticky. The relative and absolute properties seemed to be the same, and I had trouble figuring out how they were different and how to use them. I think I understand it now; you would use absolute to move elements relative to their parent, and relative to move elements relative to their static position.

I was able to get the results I wanted without using floats, which makes me wonder how I should use them. It seems like float: right is not as precise as combining right, position, and display to get an element aligned to the right.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Getting the colors and borders was easy, but positioning was the hardest. I was creating all sorts of convoluted classes and messy html layouts just trying to line everything up properly. I had the most trouble getting my profile picture to stay where I wanted it. After learning how to use the browser dev tools, I had a much easier time of it. I replicated the .container class used in J Ky Marsh's CSS video to give the page a nice frame and make it mobile friendly.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I tried to use the Atomic conventions exclusively, and I found my html getting a little crowded. I can see how Atomic will make it easy to replicate the visual style of the main page on other pages of the same site, but it seems cumbersome sometimes. I get the sense that I Atomic isn't best for everything, and I want to spend more time learning how it should be used.
