    I love programming as much as I love Classical music.

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      I began studying piano at the age of 7, and have been playing ever since. I went to Stony Brook University to study music for four years, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. However, I couldn't imagine myself in a musical career without many more years of schooling, and even then I had no idea what such a career would look like.

      It wasn't until some time late in 2014 that I realized I had a passion for programming. Logic puzzles, creativity, and mathematics were all things that I loved, but I had never realized they all existed in programming. I first tried my hand at writing code because I wanted to get involved with making video games. I tried making a simple top-down shooter in Flash using ActionScript ( back when Flash was owned by Macromedia, that's how long ago! ). I hadn't realized just how much I'd need to know to make it work properly. Despite reading several online tutorials and buying a heavy book on ActionScript, I never managed to make that game.

      Many years later I came back to the idea of programming and started working from as low-level as I could rationalize: C++. I chose C++ for two reasons: it's one of the oldest coding languages that is still widely used and respected, and many of the most popular high-level languages are based in C ( like Ruby and Javascript ). I wanted to experience some of the history of the language without replicating it exactly, so I enslisted some open source libraries to help me along.

      Working with C++ to make a game ignited my passion for programming, and when I knew I could set programming as a career goal, I leapt at the opportunity.
